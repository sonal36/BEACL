|image-4| This is how the edit permission screen works. As the ACLs work transparently, there is no
noticeable difference in TYPO3 except in the Web->Access-Module. Beneath the table, you see the
“Add ACL” button.

You can see the permissions for each group where there is an ACL set here. This screen shows you for
example that there is a new ACL on “page1” for the group “g1” (because the permissions
change there.)

There is a new user/group selector in the “Permissions” view which can be found in Web->Access.
With these selectors it is possible to define which groups and users should be shown in the matrix.
This makes especially bigger matrices easier to handle.
