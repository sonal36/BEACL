Users manual
============

To create a new ACL, open the web->access module and edit the page permissions as usually. You will
notice a small “new”-icon under the table. Click the icon and a new ACL appears.

You have to choose now if you want to create a user ACL or a group ACL. After that, select the
user/group in the other selectorbox you want to create the ACL for. The permissions work as usual.
